# Awesome Falsehoods Programmers Believe [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A collection of resources about falsehoods programmers believe to know.

Things that look simple at a first glance might have a hidden complexity unter the hood:

* When you grew up in a western country you might expect that every person's name is made up of a first and a last name.
* A programmers from the US might assume that each country is devided into states and therefore an address must contain a state name to be valid.
* Developers from Central Europa might neglect time zones, because they never experienced time zone differences when traveling into a neighboring country.
* Math teaches us that ``0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3`, but is that true in computer languages?

This is a list about articles that are worth reading when you are a software engineer or you just wonder about the hidden complexity developers have to deal with.
